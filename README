World of Warcraft Optimizer
---------------------------
Wowopt is a solver that finds the optimal combination of items, gems, enchants, and reforges for a given set of items, stat weights, and side constraints.

Warning
-------
This software is completely unsupported, it was written for the solely for amusement and therefore no support of help will be provided in the case of any problems. Use at your own risk, however if you want to share any enchantments or improvements that you've done feel free to contact me at karl.sundequist.blomdahl+wowopt@gmail.com.

Requirements
------------
Wowopt (and it's user interface) is written in Python 2.6 and requires the following libraries:
    * TkInter (http://docs.python.org/library/tkinter.html)
    * Tix (http://docs.python.org/library/tix.html)
    * pulp-OR (http://code.google.com/p/pulp-or/)
    * pycurl (http://pycurl.sourceforge.net/)
    * lxml (http://lxml.de/)

Only the GLPK and CoinMP (standalone) backends of pulp-OR has been tested.

-------
Running
-------
To run wowopt one should use the "run.sh" bash script, which will take care of running the main solver and starting the user interface. The shell script does not take any significant options beyond the character file to optimize:

    ./run.sh <character file>

The character file is an XML file describing the pieces of available gear, stat weights, and any additional side constraints. The exact format of a character file will not be described here, however one can find several examples, with a lot of explanations, in the "character/" directory:

    * "character/Cherdin@eu-Alonsus.xml": Describes a discipline priest.
    * "character/Ecdab@eu-Alonsus.xml": Describes a blood death knight.
    * "character/Kiaclei@eu-Alonsus.xml": Describes a balance druid.
    * "character/HealPriest-T12.xml": Describes the BiS gear from tier 12 for a healing priest.

The user interface of wowopt is non-interactive, it presents a table containing each item that is part of the optimal solution together with the best reforge, gems, and enchant available.
