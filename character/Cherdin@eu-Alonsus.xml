  <!-- Any additional constraints that one might want to add
       to the model. A constraint is written in Python with
       *full* access to all internal states of the solver.

       Note that you need to follow all standard coding
       conventions, such as line indention, when writing
       the Python code. The only help the solver provides is
       that is strip all whitespace from the end of your
       constraint.
